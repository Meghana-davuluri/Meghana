    <p>
        We have decided to release this book Raseswari Sri Radha, in several languages with a view to disseminate
        the super-eminence of Sri Radhaji throughout the world. Apart from making this book available to one and 
        all we have one singular aim i.e. to facilitate large number of people perform continuous, incessant meditation 
        of Sri Radhaji as guided by Divine Voice in the 80th Sloka (Verse) of the Holy book -Sri Radha Sudhanidhi. 
        As a consequence of this meditation the Karma (result of actions) of such fortunate devotees will leave on its own. 
        When Karma is dissolved Beings will be endowed with Divine Power and Energy and ascend to Higher Planes. 
       This is an invaluable message given by Sri Radhaji.
