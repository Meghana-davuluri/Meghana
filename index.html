    <!-- About sastras--> 
    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
        Sri Krishna declares in his divine Gita, that none should neglect sastras and spiritual guidance, 
        which sastras give us. He also warns that whoever wontedly neglects sastras and tries to follow his own likes 
        in spiritual matters will not only failed to march on the spiritual path, but must face unhappiness and 
        disappointments in his spiritual endeavors.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Sastras declared that Satsanga itself very greatly helps the jeeva in his spiritual march. 
        Founder of this ashram has taken great pains for a number of years in collecting the divine experiences 
        of several spiritual erupts. When once Sri Vivekananda went to Jerusalem, he could learn from a sage there
         a secret spiritual sadhana followed by Jesus Christ. Many sadhakas forget this fact that their own lower 
         self which impedes their progress at every step, acts as his enemy. The GITA also warns that the man is his
          own friend and savior and that man is his own enemy. Another famous saint from south India, by name ?Tayumanavar
           Swamy? narrates to us how the nameless and formless sadhana of divine silence or mouna can lead us to very great
            spiritual heights. Almost all the great sages of India have laid great stress on the absolute necessity of study 
            and sadhana of great messages of Vedas.Therefore several declarations of Vedas are to be seen in this website
    </p>
    <p>
        We believe that this knowledge is not the absolute property of any religion. We should develop our spiritual 
        sadhana on a scientific basis without yielding to any religious bias. We want to warn the readers to avoid all 
        bias of certain black spots in religious practices of certain religions. We believe that God is truth and truth 
        is not confined to any particular religion or religious bias. India was onetime the world?s head of spiritual 
        wisdom. Vivenkananda also frequently was declaring in America, that India is a great mine of spiritual wisdom, 
        and that he has come to America to reveal the beauties of this wealth. It is really unfortunate that the great 
        Indian philosophy is slowly being forgotten and thrown to backbenches in the modern universities.    
    </p>
    <p>
        Our motto is to have great respect for al spiritual seers of this world. We believe that the earnest seekers of truth, 
        living in different corners of the world will study this book in an unbiased mood and as a scientific research scholar. I
       sss  thank all friends and disciples for their anxiety to spread this divine wisdom throughout this world. 
         Before closing this introduction let me offer my hearty devotional prayers to Sri Radhaji
         who is the spiritual guide and light and love for millions of souls in India and abroad
    </p>
